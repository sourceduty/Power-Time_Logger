> Power-Time Logger v1.0 for Arduino UNO and LCD Keypad Shield.

### Power-Time Logger

Records each time a USB port is powered on/off and logs the data for 365 days before it resets automatically.

Press the SELECT button to switch between total on/off and total time.

Press the LEFT button to reset the program.

Use this project to log usage times for any device that has an on/off USB port (wi-fi router, 3D printer, computer, etc.).

### Power-Time Calculation

The term "power over time" typically refers to how power changes or is distributed over a period of time. Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. Mathematically, power (P) is the work done (W) or energy transferred (E) divided by the time interval (t):

P = W / t

Power-Time Calculation

1. Instantaneous Power: This is the power at a specific moment in time. It can be calculated using the formula:
   P(t) = dW / dt
   where P(t) is the instantaneous power, and dW/dt is the derivative of work with respect to time.

2. Average Power: This is the average amount of power over a specific time interval. It is calculated using:
   P_avg = ΔW / Δt
   where ΔW is the total work done over the time interval Δt.

### Power-Time Ratio

The specific idea of analyzing how power changes over time, such as calculating the instantaneous power or the average power over a time interval, likely developed as physics and engineering disciplines matured in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The term "power-time ratio" doesn't have a standard definition in physics, but it can be interpreted in a couple of ways:

1. Efficiency Measurement: It could be used to describe the ratio of power output to time taken, essentially showing how much power is used or generated per unit of time.
   
2. Comparative Metric: In some contexts, it might be used to compare the power output at different times, especially in performance analysis, to see how power usage changes over time.

   For example, if you have power measurements at different times P1 at time t1 and P2 at time t2, you could express a power-time ratio as:
   Power-Time Ratio = (P2 - P1) / (t2 - t1)

This ratio can be used to analyze the rate of change in power over a given time interval. Power over time refers to how power is calculated or varies across a time interval. Power-Time Ratio could be a measure of how power changes over time or a performance metric in specific contexts.
